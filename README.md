# presentation-datadoct2018-ml2
Presentation I gave for the Data conference at Universite Grenoble Alpes Dec 12, 2018 (https://datadoct2018.sciencesconf.org/). Discusses Many Labs 2 and issues surrounding replication. 

Easiest viewing is with the [.pdf file](https://github.com/raklein/presentation-datadoct2018-ml2/blob/master/cropped_script.pdf) although you can also download the whole directory and and edit the R script.

Created with the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) R package.
